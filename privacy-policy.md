# Privacy Policy
**Effective Date:** 9/25/2025

This Privacy Policy explains what data Flam’s Rubbish Bin (the “Bot”) collects, how it is used, and your rights regarding that data.
## 1. Data We Collect
- Bot console logs, which are temporary and redacted to exclude sensitive information.
This section may be updated.
## 2. How we use data
- For debugging, bot development, and error diagnosis.
This section will explain the uses of the data described in the previous section.
## 3. Data Storage & Retention
- Data is stored as long as needed for functionality.
- Data may occasionally be completely deleted without warning.
- If you remove the Bot from your server, any stored data associated with that server will be deleted within a reasonable timeframe.
## 4. Sharing of Data
- We do not sell or share your data with third parties
- Data may be shared only if required by law or to comply with Discord policies.
- Logs are temporary and redacted to remove sensitive data. Because they are short-lived and non-sensitive, they are not encrypted.
- If any new persistent data is stored in the future, it will always be encrypted (no exceptions).
## 5. Your Rights
- You may request deletion of any persistent configuration data. Temporary console logs are automatically deleted within a reasonable timeframe and may not be individually removed.
- Removing the Bot from your server will also delete stored data associated with that server.
## 6. Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated when data collection practices change. Updates will be reflected here with a new "Effective Date."
